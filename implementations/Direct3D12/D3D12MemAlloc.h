\page quick_start Quick start

\section quick_start_project_setup Project setup and initialization

This is a small, standalone C++ library. It consists of a pair of 2 files:
"%D3D12MemAlloc.h" header file with public interface and "D3D12MemAlloc.cpp" with
internal implementation. The only external dependencies are WinAPI, Direct3D 12,
and parts of C/C++ standard library (but STL containers, exceptions, or RTTI are
not used).

The library is developed and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, but it
should work with other compilers as well. It is designed for 64-bit code.

To use the library in your project:

(1.) Copy files `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp`, `%D3D12MemAlloc.h` to your project.

(2.) Make `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp` compiling as part of the project, as C++ code.

(3.) Include library header in each CPP file that needs to use the library.

\code
#include "D3D12MemAlloc.h"
\endcode

(4.) Right after you created `ID3D12Device`, fill D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC
structure and call function D3D12MA::CreateAllocator to create the main
D3D12MA::Allocator object.

Please note that all symbols of the library are declared inside #D3D12MA namespace.

\code
ID3D12Device* device = (...)

D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC allocatorDesc = {};
allocatorDesc.pDevice = device;

D3D12MA::Allocator* allocator;
HRESULT hr = D3D12MA::CreateAllocator(&allocatorDesc, &allocator);
\endcode

(5.) Right before destroying the D3D12 device, destroy the allocator object.

Please note that objects of this library must be destroyed by calling `Release`
method (despite they are not COM interfaces and no reference counting is involved).

\code
allocator->Release();
device->Release();
\endcode


\section quick_start_creating_resources Creating resources

To use the library for creating resources (textures and buffers), call method
D3D12MA::Allocator::CreateResource in the place where you would previously call
`ID3D12Device::CreateCommittedResource`.

The function has similar syntax, but it expects structure D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC
to be passed along with `D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC` and other parameters for created
resource. This structure describes parameters of the desired memory allocation,
including choice of `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE`.

The function also returns a new object of type D3D12MA::Allocation, created along
with usual `ID3D12Resource`. It represents allocated memory and can be queried
for size, offset, and `ID3D12Heap` if needed.

\code
D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC resourceDesc = {};
resourceDesc.Dimension = D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D;
resourceDesc.Alignment = 0;
resourceDesc.Width = 1024;
resourceDesc.Height = 1024;
resourceDesc.DepthOrArraySize = 1;
resourceDesc.MipLevels = 1;
resourceDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Count = 1;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Quality = 0;
resourceDesc.Layout = D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN;
resourceDesc.Flags = D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_NONE;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC allocationDesc = {};
allocDesc.HeapType = D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT;

D3D12Resource* resource;
D3D12MA::Allocation* allocation;
HRESULT hr = allocator->CreateResource(
    &allocationDesc,
    &resourceDesc,
    D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST,
    NULL,
    &allocation,
    IID_PPV_ARGS(&resource));
\endcode

You need to remember both resource and allocation objects and destroy them
separately when no longer needed.

\code
allocation->Release();
resource->Release();
\endcode

The advantage of using the allocator instead of creating committed resource, and
the main purpose of this library, is that it can decide to allocate bigger memory
heap internally using `ID3D12Device::CreateHeap` and place multiple resources in
it, at different offsets, using `ID3D12Device::CreatePlacedResource`. The library
manages its own collection of allocated memory blocks (heaps) and remembers which
parts of them are occupied and which parts are free to be used for new resources.

The library also automatically handles resource heap tier.
When `D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS::ResourceHeapTier` equals `D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_1`,
resources of 3 types: buffers, textures that are render targets or depth-stencil,
and other textures must be kept in separate heaps. When `D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_2`,
they can be kept together. By using this library, you don't need to handle this
manually.


\section quick_start_mapping_memory Mapping memory

The process of getting regular CPU-side pointer to the memory of a resource in
Direct3D is called "mapping". There are rules and restrictions to this process,
as described in D3D12 documentation of [ID3D12Resource::Map method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12resource-map).

Mapping happens on the level of particular resources, not entire memory heaps,
and so it is out of scope of this library. Just as the linked documentation says:

- Returned pointer refers to data of particular subresource, not entire memory heap.
- You can map same resource multiple times. It is ref-counted internally.
- Mapping is thread-safe.
- Unmapping is not required before resource destruction.
- Unmapping may not be required before using written data - some heap types on
  some platforms support resources persistently mapped.

When using this library, you can map and use your resources normally without
considering whether they are created as committed resources or placed resources in one large heap.

Example for buffer created and filled in `UPLOAD` heap type:

\code
const UINT64 bufSize = 65536;
const float* bufData = (...);

D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC resourceDesc = {};
resourceDesc.Dimension = D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_BUFFER;
resourceDesc.Alignment = 0;
resourceDesc.Width = bufSize;
resourceDesc.Height = 1;
resourceDesc.DepthOrArraySize = 1;
resourceDesc.MipLevels = 1;
resourceDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_UNKNOWN;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Count = 1;
resourceDesc.SampleDesc.Quality = 0;
resourceDesc.Layout = D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_ROW_MAJOR;
resourceDesc.Flags = D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_NONE;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_DESC allocationDesc = {};
allocationDesc.HeapType = D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD;

D3D12Resource* resource;
D3D12MA::Allocation* allocation;
HRESULT hr = allocator->CreateResource(
    &allocationDesc,
    &resourceDesc,
    D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ,
    NULL,
    &allocation,
    IID_PPV_ARGS(&resource));

void* mappedPtr;
hr = resource->Map(0, NULL, &mappedPtr);

memcpy(mappedPtr, bufData, bufSize);

resource->Unmap(0, NULL);
\endcode


\page configuration Configuration

Please check file `D3D12MemAlloc.cpp` lines between "Configuration Begin" and
"Configuration End" to find macros that you can define to change the behavior of
the library, primarily for debugging purposes.

\section custom_memory_allocator Custom CPU memory allocator

If you use custom allocator for CPU memory rather than default C++ operator `new`
and `delete` or `malloc` and `free` functions, you can make this library using
your allocator as well by filling structure D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_CALLBACKS and
passing it as optional member D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC::pAllocationCallbacks.
Functions pointed there will be used by the library to make any CPU-side
allocations. Example:

\code
#include <malloc.h>

void* CustomAllocate(size_t Size, size_t Alignment, void* pUserData)
{
    void* memory = _aligned_malloc(Size, Alignment);
    // Your extra bookkeeping here...
    return memory;
}

void CustomFree(void* pMemory, void* pUserData)
{
    // Your extra bookkeeping here...
    _aligned_free(pMemory);
}

(...)

D3D12MA::ALLOCATION_CALLBACKS allocationCallbacks = {};
allocationCallbacks.pAllocate = &CustomAllocate;
allocationCallbacks.pFree = &CustomFree;

D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_DESC allocatorDesc = {};
allocatorDesc.pDevice = device;
allocatorDesc.pAllocationCallbacks = &allocationCallbacks;

D3D12MA::Allocator* allocator;
HRESULT hr = D3D12MA::CreateAllocator(&allocatorDesc, &allocator);
\endcode


\page general_considerations General considerations

\section general_considerations_thread_safety Thread safety

- The library has no global state, so separate D3D12MA::Allocator objects can be used independently.
  In typical applications there should be no need to create multiple such objects though - one per `ID3D12Device` is enough.
- All calls to methods of D3D12MA::Allocator class are safe to be made from multiple
  threads simultaneously because they are synchronized internally when needed.
- When the allocator is created with D3D12MA::ALLOCATOR_FLAG_SINGLETHREADED,
  calls to methods of D3D12MA::Allocator class must be made from a single thread or synchronized by the user.
  Using this flag may improve performance.

\section general_considerations_future_plans Future plans

Features planned for future releases:

Near future: feature parity with [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator/), including:

- Custom memory pools
- Alternative allocation algorithms: linear allocator, buddy allocator
- JSON dump that can be visualized on a picture
- Support for priorities using `ID3D12Device1::SetResidencyPriority`
- Support for "lost" allocations

Later:

- Memory defragmentation
- Query for memory budget using `IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo` and
  sticking to this budget with allocations
- Support for resource aliasing (overlap)
- Support for multi-GPU (multi-adapter)

\section general_considerations_features_not_supported Features not supported

Features deliberately excluded from the scope of this library:

- Descriptor allocation. Although also called "heaps", objects that represent
  descriptors are separate part of the D3D12 API from buffers and textures.
- Support for `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_CUSTOM`. Only the default heap types are supported:
  `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD`, `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT`, `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_READBACK`.
- Support for reserved (tiled) resources. We don't recommend using them.
- Support for `ID3D12Device::Evict` and `MakeResident`. We don't recommend using them.
